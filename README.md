# Project 1
# In this project our goal is to validate one dictionary structure against a
# template dictionary.
#
# A typical example of this might be working with JSON data inputs in an API.
# You are trying to validate this received JSON against some kind of template
# to make sure the received JSON conforms to that template (i.e. all the keys
# and structure are identical - value types being important, but not the value
# itself - so just the structure, and the data type of the values).
#
# To keep things simple we'll assume that values can be either single values
# (like an integer, string, etc), or a dictionary, itself only containing single
# values or other dictionaries, recursively. In other words, we're not going to
# deal with lists as possible values. Also, to keep things simple, we'll assume
# that all keys are required, and that no extra keys are permitted.
#
# In practice we would not have these simplifying assumptions, and although we
# could definitely write this ourselves, there are many 3rd party libraries that
# already exist to do this (such as jsonschema, marshmallow, and many more, some
# of which I'll cover lightly in some later videos.)
#
# For example you might have this template:
